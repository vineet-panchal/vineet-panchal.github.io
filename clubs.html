            <p id="clubs-writeup">The importance of clubs & councils is that it gives you something fun to do aside from school. It allows you to explore what you may be interested in beyond academics. Being part of a club/council will enable you to make new friends and meet new people and provides you with a support network. Here at SJPII, there are a variety of clubs and councils that you can join. From the Coding Club to the Executive Student Council, there are many things you can do aside from academics at SJPII.</p>

            <p id="esc-writeup">The Executive Student Council (ESC) works to do primarily two things simultaneously; foster school spirit and amplify the student voice. We come together as leaders to plan and implement initiatives, events, and activities that help students have the best time possible here at SJPII and feel that they are a valued member of the Panther community. From events like spirit week and winterlicious, to holding trivia and town halls, we want all students to get involved, and hope that we can have a lasting impact on our school community. Our members are always willing to help and our dms are always open @escsjpii on instagram or by emailing escsjpii@gmail.com. If you ever need anything at all, or have questions, suggestions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out! </p>

We focus on all strands of art such as Visual, Musical, Cinematic, Literature, etc. Every Wednesday in room 258, we discuss initiatives that can be done around the school in order to show off all our panther's artistic talents. Coming to a meeting is a great way to chill with fellow panthers as well as get hours! For every meeting attended that is one hour gained for you. Also if you participate in an initiative (make an announcement, post, or even cut up a picture) you also get hours! Our committee is dedicated to bringing out the creative sides of those who are afraid to show off their skills. For more information dm @sjp.arts or email us at sjpiiartcommittee@gmail.com</p>
